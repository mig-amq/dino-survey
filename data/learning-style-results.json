Compared to other people, your spatial awareness is impressively greater!\r\nThese people learn best when seemingly abstract lessons are made concrete via visual\r\nrelationships, such as when a teacher uses a flowchart to illustrate a sequence of events.

Compared to other people, your\r\ncommunication skills may be a lot stronger!\r\nAuditory learners also like to engage in verbal discussions with others.
