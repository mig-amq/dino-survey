        <h3 class="title">What are Study Habits?</h3>
        <p>
          Study habits refer to the behaviors, techniques, and strategies that students use to learn
          and retain information. In addition to this, study habits can also be defined as a type of time
          management, in which a person dedicates a certain period of time purely for learning.
        </p>

        <strong>Here are some examples of study habits:</strong>

        <p>
          The <strong>Pomodoro technique</strong>, a time-management method, suggests breaking down study
          sessions into <i>25-minute intervals</i> with short breaks in between to improve focus and
          productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technique is indeed one of the effective ways to combat procrastination. It helps
          students to break down big tasks, projects, or even goals that could be done or finished for
          the next 25 minutes. It can also help students to be hyper focused on the next, immediate
          tasks that they must do rather than get overwhelmed by the overall enormity of tasks that
          they are working on.
        </p>

        <div style="margin: 20px 0">
          <img src="./img/pomodoro-steps.png" alt="Pomodoro Steps" width="100%" height="auto">
        </div>

        <p>
          The pomodoro technique can help students also to combat distractions. It helps students to
          resist all self-interruptions and can retrain the brain to focus on the task. It is said that one
          pomodoro is set only for a specific task and each break is known as a chance to reset and
          brings one attention back to what they are doing. Lastly, pomodoro technique helps
          students to become more aware about their time. It will help students to have a clear
          measurement of their finite time and efforts, allowing them to reflect and plan their days
          more accurately and efficiently. Pomodoro technique also can gamify students' productivity.
          Each pomodoro that is done gives an opportunity to improve things that were done last
          time. Each pomodoro can provide the chance to reevaluate a student's goal, challenge self
          to focus, and limit distractions. Indeed, developing good study habits via the pomodoro
          technique can actually help students to develop time management skills. It allows the
          students to manage their time effectively and do things systematically.
        </p>

        <p class="left-image">
          <img src="./img/study.jpg" alt="Study Habits" srcset="" height="auto" width="100%">

          That being said, study habits are more than just time management. As the term suggests,
          one can hone their study habits by, well, developing certain habits–like reading habits.
          There are several factors that contribute to developing reading habits, such as a person’s
          motivation for reading, the environment in which they read, and the type of literature they
          consume. One way to improve reading habits is by taking notes of what is being read to
          better digest the information. You can create habits too with enough motivation; form
          effective study habits by rewarding yourself (treat yourself to a favorite snack, watch a
          movie, etc.) every time you succeed in your study goals. 
          Good study habits can help improve academic performance, increase motivation, and
          reduce stress levels. Having good study habits could improve one’s grade drastically, since
          having a solid study plan makes for less room for errors; thus, it improves one’s academic
          performance. Good study habits can also improve the knowledge base of individuals.
          Instead of skimming through on a certain material, one is required to dig deeper into that
          material. It's a matter of having a deeper understanding of things rather than just
          memorizing facts and figures. In fact, research shows that practicing self-testing and
          effective study time strategies can improve long-term memory retention. For example,
          people who can strategize which items in their notes should be prioritized for studying in a
          set period of time are more likely to recall those items from memory over a longer period of
          time. This can come in handy when preparing for a test; knowing which lessons should be
          prioritized for studying can increase the chances of passing that test.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having good study habits can also develop or boost the confidence of individuals or students
          by giving the feeling that they control their studies and not their studies are controlling
          them. It can also improve students' performance as well and can give structure to their lives.
          In this way, good study habits can also reduce their stress.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title">Recommended Study Habits</h3>
        
        <p>Here are some recommended study habits:</p>

          <div class="details">
              <h5>Set aside any distractions</h5>
              <p>Distractions can make you feel forgetful at times, usually when you get pulled away
                from what you're doing and lose contact with your intentions, and having to retrace
                where you left off.</p>
              <p>There is only a lot of information your brain can process at the same time. So, doing
                two or more tasks requires more brain power than just doing one. In doing academic
                work, distractions can make you lose your attentiveness.</p>
              <p>In the end, distractions take away productivity and push you to procrastination and
                loss of capability. You can limit distractions by avoiding or turning them off, planning
                ahead or practicing meditation. Distraction can also be initiated by physical ailments
                so make sure to take care of yourself as well by taking breaks or sleeping when you
                need to.</p>

          <div class="details">
              <h5>Take breaks when you need to</h5>
              <p>Overworking, especially in academic set-ups can cause burnout and is harmful
                against your overall performance. You may end up fighting that tiredness by fighting
                against it, but you might spend too much time doing that to the point where you
                become unproductive in your actual work.</p>
              <p>Taking breaks can revitalize the energy you’ve lost and improve your overall mental
                and physical health. You can take short breaks between study sessions, or simply
                take a big break before taking your time to study. Make sure to rest moderately, and
                in appropriate times.</p>

              <h5>Use (active learning) techniques</h5>
              <p>Sometimes, doing things the harder way takes away the time we can use for doing
                other productive things, but doing it in a smarter way not only does the opposite,
                but also helps us become more advanced, taking in our lessons more efficiently than
                most.</p>
              <p>Using active learning techniques can help you achieve this. There are a lot of
                different techniques, including summarizing, note-taking, explaining concepts to
                others, and taking practice quizzes. This list, in a way, is also a set of techniques.
                What matters most is that it works efficiently and well for you.</p>

                unfortunately, you’re unfamiliar with everything on it.</p>
              <p>Taking practice tests can give yourself a deeper look into your study gaps that you
                can fill in until you get everything perfect. Not only that, but you will be more
                relaxed after expecting the questions, layouts, answering methods, etc… and
                guarantee yourself a high score.</p>

                a fixed mindset can limit your potential and hold you back from reaching your goals.</p>

                distraction, losing self-care; becoming self-destructive in general.</p>
              <p>A solution to this is rewarding yourself for your accomplishments. You can even cut
                your sessions into pieces and reward yourself in between, maybe through resting, a
                prize, etc… Your brain will associate doing this task to a pleasurable future, through
                an objective. You’re sharing the pleasure of a promised future to your present self.</p>

                work may not be as good as we want it to be; messy.</p>
              <p>Studying in advance can help you efficiently pass you through lessons while also
                being more organized and productive. You will have more time to do your work in a
                way that you want to without constraint, and continue to do other things. It’s a way
                to be relaxed while also accomplishing tasks.</p>

              <h5>Break goals into smaller, more achievable tasks.</h5>
              <p>When your teacher gives you a book to read, they usually don’t tell you to read the
                whole thing in one sitting; instead, you’re made to read it through chapters. If not,
                then doing this task would feel impossible and tedious, which gets in the way of
                concentrating and progressing through it.</p>
              <p>Breaking down goals is like a mixture of rewarding yourself and studying in advance.
                You would be more mindful in these short bouts of tasks, without the stress of
                wondering what more you have to do. It feels easier to get to this goal, so it feels
                rewarding, so you keep going until you finish. You can do this by dividing your time
                into a few minutes, or simply making a to-do-list/schedule.</p>

              <h5>Intend your schedule.</h5>
              <p>At some point in your school life, you might fall into being overwhelmed by work;
                what do you have to do next? Is this everything you need to do? Did you miss
                something? It can be very confusing and messy, having to retrace everything and
                wasting time.</p>
              <p>Scheduling gives you a glimpse into a quick and easy routine, and every step feels
                rewarding. Not only that, but you become a lot more organized and up-to-date with
                your deadlines. You could create one by writing your deadlines on something or
                using a planner.</p>

              <h5>Take care of yourself.</h5>
              <p>Mental health is very important in life, overall. This could affect how you do at work
                or in school. If this declines, it could lead to symptoms of illnesses like body-aches,
                tiredness, loss of motivation, relentless thoughts and worries, emptiness, etc… all of
                which should be dealt with appropriately, but that can also take you away from
                doing academic tasks.</p>
              <p>The best to do is to make sure that doesn’t happen by the onset. You can take a rest
                or sleep when you have to, set up a routine to take a bath, eat, and do everything
                you need to do with the most energy and desired emotion.</p>

        <p>
          Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their ability to accomplish a specific task or achieve a goal. Self-efficacy also plays a part in influencing a person's decision-making, how they respond to hindrances, and their ways of thinking (Bandura, 1997). In this case, it is a key component of motivation and can influence how a student approaches their academic work. Students with high self-efficacy exhibit confidence in their capabilities, such as believing that they can solve a challenging math problem, or feeling confident in their ability to write a compelling essay.

        <h3 class="title">Importance/Relevance of Self-Efficacy</h3>
        <p>
          Self-efficacy is important because it can impact a student's academic performance and overall well-being. When students have a strong sense of self-efficacy, they are more likely to set ambitious goals, persist through challenges, and bounce back from failures. However, those with low self-efficacy tend to procrastinate, avoid challenges, have less confidence, and struggle moving past setbacks and their lack of achievement.

          <img src="./img/survey.webp" alt="Study" srcset="" height="auto" width="100%"> 
          That being the case, it is important to strengthen one's self-efficacy. Practicing self-efficacy can be achieved by setting achievable goals, celebrating successes, and seeking out positive feedback.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A study conducted by Alay Ahmad and Triantoro Safaria (2013) shows that those who have high self-efficacy would be more willing to take on more difficult challenges (such as taking more complex courses) and by John Lane and Andrew M. Lane (2001), it was found that self-efficacy was indeed correlated to academic performance. In fact, self-efficacy served as a predictor for success as claimed in other studies. In an article "Believe to Succeed: 9 ways to boost your Self-Efficacy" (2021), those who do not think they have to make significant differences, tend to react passively when they are given challenges or when they find themselves in a situation they have not experienced. This leads them to avoiding new experiences because they already have the thinking they would not be able to succeed.
